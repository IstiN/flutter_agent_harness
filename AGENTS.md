# AGENTS.md

Conventions for AI agents and contributors working in this repository.

## Project layout

- `lib/` — the `flutter_agent_harness` package (pure Dart core).
- `lib/src/approval/` — the tool approval gate: capability tiers
  (read/write/exec, exec for undeclared tools) on `AgentTool`, session modes
  (always-ask/write/yolo), per-tool allow/deny/prompt overrides, and the
  critical-pattern `bash` interceptor. Wired into the agent's
  `beforeToolCall` phase via `attachApproval` (composes with user hooks,
  approval runs first); the prompt UI is an injectable `ApprovalPrompt`
  callback (null callback + prompt policy = deny).
- `lib/src/tools/ask_tool.dart` — the `ask` tool (ported from oh-my-pi):
  structured mid-turn questions (labeled options, optional multi-select and
  a recommended index/label) answered by the host through an injectable
  `AskCallback` (same host-callback pattern as `ApprovalPrompt`). A null
  callback yields an error result ("host cannot answer"); a cancelled dialog
  yields a plain "ask cancelled by user" result. The CLI renders a stdin
  menu, the example app a modal bottom sheet (`ask_ui.dart`); both register
  the tool next to `builtinTools`.
- `lib/src/hashline/` — the hashline patch language (ported from oh-my-pi
  `packages/hashline`): `[path#TAG]` section headers with a 4-hex whole-file
  content hash (xxHash32, ported in `xxhash32.dart`), `SWAP`/`DEL`/`INS.*`
  line-range ops, the per-session `HashlineSnapshotStore`, and the
  all-or-nothing `HashlinePatcher` over `ExecutionEnv`. Stale tags reject
  before any write. omp's tree-sitter block ops (`*.BLK`), file ops
  (`REM`/`MV`), boundary-repair leniency, and diff-based stale-anchor
  auto-remap are deliberately not ported. Wired into the built-in tools in
  `lib/src/tools/builtin_tools.dart`: `edit` accepts a `patch` argument
  (hashline mode) next to legacy `oldText`/`newText`, and `read` gains a
  `hashline` flag emitting numbered lines + the tag header; both share one
  session snapshot store via `builtinTools`.
- `bin/fah.dart` — the `fah`/`fa` CLI executable.
- `example/flutter_example/` — Flutter chat example (mobile/web sandbox).
- `site/` — static GitHub Pages landing (hand-rolled HTML/CSS/JS, no build
  step). `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds the Flutter web demo into
  `app/` inside the Pages artifact (never committed) and deploys on pushes
  touching `site/`, `example/`, `lib/`, or `vendor/`.
- `prompts/` — all LLM prompts as Markdown (see below); `test/` mirrors `lib/`.
- `example/flutter_example/lib/sandbox_registry.dart` — the central registry
  of sandbox shell commands per platform (web/mobile/desktop). The shells
  resolve against its name sets, and the Fa system prompt's `{{commands}}`
  placeholder is rendered from it (`AgentService`). Never list commands in
  prompt text or UI by hand.
- `scripts/` — codegen and quality-gate scripts.

## Hard architecture rules

- `lib/` is pure Dart: **no `dart:io`** (it must compile for web). The only
  `dart:io` entry points are `bin/` and `lib/io.dart`; file, process, and
  network access behind the agent's tools goes through the `ExecutionEnv`
  abstraction.

## Prompts live outside Dart code

- Every LLM prompt is a Markdown file under `prompts/**` (example app:
  `example/flutter_example/prompts/`). Never write prompt string literals in
  `.dart` files — prompts must be findable and reviewable as Markdown.
- File format: YAML frontmatter between `---` lines (`name`, `description`),
  then the prompt body verbatim. Runtime placeholders are `{{name}}` tokens
  (e.g. `{{cwd}}`) substituted by the consuming Dart code.
- After editing a prompt, regenerate and commit the compiled constants:
  `dart run scripts/gen_prompts.dart` rewrites `lib/src/prompts/prompts.g.dart`
  and `example/flutter_example/lib/prompts.g.dart` — generated files, never
  edit by hand.
- `test/prompts/prompts_sync_test.dart` reruns the generation and fails the
  test gate on any drift.

## Quality gates (pre-commit hook: `scripts/pre-commit`)

- `dart analyze` and `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` clean.
- `dart test` green (integration-tagged tests excluded; they run in CI).
- Line coverage of `lib/` ≥ 80%; jscpd duplication < 1%.
- Max 2800 lines per `.dart` file (`*.g.dart` exempt).
- Example app: `cd example/flutter_example && flutter test`.

## Commits and releases

- Commit subjects follow `type(scope): ...` — e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `fix(example):`, `ci:`, `test(providers):`, `refactor(prompts):`.
- Every push to `main` triggers an automatic patch release to pub.dev
  (`scripts/auto_release.sh` via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — intended.
