# AGENTS.md

Conventions for AI agents and contributors working in this repository.

## Project layout

- `lib/` — the `flutter_agent_harness` package (pure Dart core).
- `bin/fah.dart` — the `fah`/`fa` CLI executable.
- `example/flutter_example/` — Flutter chat example (mobile/web sandbox).
- `site/` — static GitHub Pages landing (hand-rolled HTML/CSS/JS, no build
  step). `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds the Flutter web demo into
  `app/` inside the Pages artifact (never committed) and deploys on pushes
  touching `site/`, `example/`, `lib/`, or `vendor/`.
- `prompts/` — all LLM prompts as Markdown (see below); `test/` mirrors `lib/`.
- `scripts/` — codegen and quality-gate scripts.

## Hard architecture rules

- `lib/` is pure Dart: **no `dart:io`** (it must compile for web). The only
  `dart:io` entry points are `bin/` and `lib/io.dart`; file, process, and
  network access behind the agent's tools goes through the `ExecutionEnv`
  abstraction.

## Prompts live outside Dart code

- Every LLM prompt is a Markdown file under `prompts/**` (example app:
  `example/flutter_example/prompts/`). Never write prompt string literals in
  `.dart` files — prompts must be findable and reviewable as Markdown.
- File format: YAML frontmatter between `---` lines (`name`, `description`),
  then the prompt body verbatim. Runtime placeholders are `{{name}}` tokens
  (e.g. `{{cwd}}`) substituted by the consuming Dart code.
- After editing a prompt, regenerate and commit the compiled constants:
  `dart run scripts/gen_prompts.dart` rewrites `lib/src/prompts/prompts.g.dart`
  and `example/flutter_example/lib/prompts.g.dart` — generated files, never
  edit by hand.
- `test/prompts/prompts_sync_test.dart` reruns the generation and fails the
  test gate on any drift.

## Quality gates (pre-commit hook: `scripts/pre-commit`)

- `dart analyze` and `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` clean.
- `dart test` green (integration-tagged tests excluded; they run in CI).
- Line coverage of `lib/` ≥ 80%; jscpd duplication < 1%.
- Max 2800 lines per `.dart` file (`*.g.dart` exempt).
- Example app: `cd example/flutter_example && flutter test`.

## Commits and releases

- Commit subjects follow `type(scope): ...` — e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `fix(example):`, `ci:`, `test(providers):`, `refactor(prompts):`.
- Every push to `main` triggers an automatic patch release to pub.dev
  (`scripts/auto_release.sh` via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — intended.
